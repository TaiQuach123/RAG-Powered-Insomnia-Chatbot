Non-fatal suicidal behavior including suicidal thought (ST), suicide plan (SP), and suicide attempt (SA) has been identified as the strongest predictor of suicide death and is prevalent among adolescents. Non-fatal suicidal behavior is multifactorial. Numerous studies have shown demographical, biological, and psychosocial factors (i.e. female gender, age, parental separation, or divorce, serotonin activity, and mental disorders) are associated with non-fatal suicidal behavior.\\n\\nInsomnia disorder, manifested as recurrent and chronic perceived sleep dissatisfaction occurring several times per week, is one of the common sleep problems among adolescents. Insomnia symptoms are very common among adolescents. Growing studies have demonstrated that insomnia is a significant risk factor of adolescent suicidal behavior. The link between insomnia and suicidal behavior is complicated and may be mediated and/or moderated by multiple factors. Anxiety and depression have been considered the most common factors that mediate the association between insomnia and suicidal behavior. However, in a meta-analysis involving 39 studies, the authors found that insomnia, nightmares, and other sleep disturbances were significantly associated with suicidal behaviors, independent of depression and anxiety (adjusted risk ratio ranging from 1.66 to 3.00). That is, in the absence of depression and anxiety, the experience of insomnia also increases the risk of suicidal behavior. Recent studies have examined other mediators, such as defeat and entrapment, hopelessness, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and nightmares. However, all these factors were mostly examined in cross-sectional studies and these factors could only explain part of the association between insomnia and suicidal behavior. To develop effective prevention and intervention programs of suicidal behavior, it is important to identify modifiable factors that mediate the association between insomnia and suicidal behavior in adolescents.\\n\\nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is also prevalent in adolescents. EDS may be a potential mediator of the insomnia-suicidal behavior link because EDS is one of the most common consequences of insomnia and because EDS is associated with increased risk of suicidal behavior. For example, in a cross-sectional study of 36,743 adults, the risk of EDS was.

Table 5 presents the relationship between chronicity of individual items of insomnia and functioning problems controlling for prior functioning, age, gender, ethnicity, family income, puberty status, and perceived body weight. Out of 70 contrasts, only 27 were statistically significant. However, a third (32.6% of non-significant OR’s were in the range of 2 to 7, but the wide confidence intervals resulted in the associations not being significant. Chronic NRS predicted eight of the 14 outcomes with OR’s ranging from 2.0 – 3.3, followed by chronic DIS with six significant outcomes, with OR’s ranging from 2.5 to 6.7. Chronic DMS was least predictive of the symptoms examined. Chronic EMA was strongly related to perceived health (OR=19.4), life satisfaction (OR=15.1), and school work (OR=19.0).\\n\\nThis is the first study to examine the effects of chronic DSM-IV insomnia on subsequent functioning of adolescents using a prospective design. Rates of chronicity were substantial, with 46% reporting symptoms of insomnia in both Wave 1 and Wave 2, and nearly one-fourth meeting our definition of clinical insomnia. Our data on chronicity corroborate earlier studies of stability of symptoms of insomnia among adolescents.\\n\\nThe implications of the chronic burden of insomnia for adolescent well-being also are profound. With minor exceptions (e.g., peer relations), chronic insomnia increased the odds of poor outcomes across multiple indicators of interpersonal, somatic and psychological functioning. For most of these outcomes, the odds of poor functioning were increased from twofold to fivefold without adjustment for covariates. Even after adjustment, most of the prospective associations remained. These results extend the findings from prior prospective studies concerning the impact of sleep problems on future functioning of adolescents. two previous epidemiologic studies have provided data on changes in sleep over time and their impact on adolescents. Data from these studies are corroborated by our results. Fredriksen et al. reported sleep deprivation over time increased risk of depression and lower self-esteem but not poor academic functioning. Gregory and O’Connor reported that the correlation of sleep problems (including symptoms of insomnia) with depression and anxiety increased over time. Other measures of functioning were not examined in either paper. Roberts, Roberts, and Chen found that symptoms of insomnia at baseline increased future risk of poor functioning for multiple indicators of somatic, psychological and interpersonal functioning. However, they did not examine the effects of chronic insomnia nor insomnia approximating DSM-IV criteria.\\n\\nWhen individual symptoms of insomnia were examined, chronic nonrestorative sleep posed the greatest risk for Wave 2 outcomes, followed by chronic difficulty initiating sleep in terms of number of outcomes affected.\\n\\nTaken together, these previous prospective studies, together with the results presented here, confirm the findings on factors associated with insomnia reported from numerous cross-sectional studies of both adolescents and adults.\\n\\nThe key contribution of the results reported here is that many of the findings about factors associated with the occurrence of insomnia, which emanate overwhelmingly from cross-sectional studies, may be the consequences rather the causes of insomnia. Like many other emotional and behavioral disorders, insomnia often is a chronic disorder, with a multifactorial etiology. In fact, in a recent paper based on analyses of TH2K prospective data, Roberts, Roberts and Chan report that risk of incident insomnia is predicted by many of the same somatic, psychological, and interpersonal factors included in the analyses reported here.

Non-fatal suicidal behavior including suicidal thought (ST), suicide plan (SP), and suicide attempt (SA) has been identified as the strongest predictor of suicide death and is prevalent among adolescents. Non-fatal suicidal behavior is multifactorial. Numerous studies have shown demographical, biological, and psychosocial factors (i.e. female gender, age, parental separation, or divorce, serotonin activity, and mental disorders) are associated with non-fatal suicidal behavior.\\n\\nInsomnia disorder, manifested as recurrent and chronic perceived sleep dissatisfaction occurring several times per week, is one of the common sleep problems among adolescents. Insomnia symptoms are very common among adolescents. Growing studies have demonstrated that insomnia is a significant risk factor of adolescent suicidal behavior. The link between insomnia and suicidal behavior is complicated and may be mediated and/or moderated by multiple factors. Anxiety and depression have been considered the most common factors that mediate the association between insomnia and suicidal behavior. However, in a meta-analysis involving 39 studies, the authors found that insomnia, nightmares, and other sleep disturbances were significantly associated with suicidal behaviors, independent of depression and anxiety (adjusted risk ratio ranging from 1.66 to 3.00). That is, in the absence of depression and anxiety, the experience of insomnia also increases the risk of suicidal behavior. Recent studies have examined other mediators, such as defeat and entrapment, hopelessness, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and nightmares. However, all these factors were mostly examined in cross-sectional studies and these factors could only explain part of the association between insomnia and suicidal behavior. To develop effective prevention and intervention programs of suicidal behavior, it is important to identify modifiable factors that mediate the association between insomnia and suicidal behavior in adolescents.\\n\\nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is also prevalent in adolescents. EDS may be a potential mediator of the insomnia-suicidal behavior link because EDS is one of the most common consequences of insomnia and because EDS is associated with increased risk of suicidal behavior. For example, in a cross-sectional study of 36,743 adults, the risk of EDS was.

Table 5 presents the relationship between chronicity of individual items of insomnia and functioning problems controlling for prior functioning, age, gender, ethnicity, family income, puberty status, and perceived body weight. Out of 70 contrasts, only 27 were statistically significant. However, a third (32.6% of non-significant OR’s were in the range of 2 to 7, but the wide confidence intervals resulted in the associations not being significant. Chronic NRS predicted eight of the 14 outcomes with OR’s ranging from 2.0 – 3.3, followed by chronic DIS with six significant outcomes, with OR’s ranging from 2.5 to 6.7. Chronic DMS was least predictive of the symptoms examined. Chronic EMA was strongly related to perceived health (OR=19.4), life satisfaction (OR=15.1), and school work (OR=19.0).\\n\\nThis is the first study to examine the effects of chronic DSM-IV insomnia on subsequent functioning of adolescents using a prospective design. Rates of chronicity were substantial, with 46% reporting symptoms of insomnia in both Wave 1 and Wave 2, and nearly one-fourth meeting our definition of clinical insomnia. Our data on chronicity corroborate earlier studies of stability of symptoms of insomnia among adolescents.\\n\\nThe implications of the chronic burden of insomnia for adolescent well-being also are profound. With minor exceptions (e.g., peer relations), chronic insomnia increased the odds of poor outcomes across multiple indicators of interpersonal, somatic and psychological functioning. For most of these outcomes, the odds of poor functioning were increased from twofold to fivefold without adjustment for covariates. Even after adjustment, most of the prospective associations remained. These results extend the findings from prior prospective studies concerning the impact of sleep problems on future functioning of adolescents. two previous epidemiologic studies have provided data on changes in sleep over time and their impact on adolescents. Data from these studies are corroborated by our results. Fredriksen et al. reported sleep deprivation over time increased risk of depression and lower self-esteem but not poor academic functioning. Gregory and O’Connor reported that the correlation of sleep problems (including symptoms of insomnia) with depression and anxiety increased over time. Other measures of functioning were not examined in either paper. Roberts, Roberts, and Chen found that symptoms of insomnia at baseline increased future risk of poor functioning for multiple indicators of somatic, psychological and interpersonal functioning. However, they did not examine the effects of chronic insomnia nor insomnia approximating DSM-IV criteria.\\n\\nWhen individual symptoms of insomnia were examined, chronic nonrestorative sleep posed the greatest risk for Wave 2 outcomes, followed by chronic difficulty initiating sleep in terms of number of outcomes affected.\\n\\nTaken together, these previous prospective studies, together with the results presented here, confirm the findings on factors associated with insomnia reported from numerous cross-sectional studies of both adolescents and adults.\\n\\nThe key contribution of the results reported here is that many of the findings about factors associated with the occurrence of insomnia, which emanate overwhelmingly from cross-sectional studies, may be the consequences rather the causes of insomnia. Like many other emotional and behavioral disorders, insomnia often is a chronic disorder, with a multifactorial etiology. In fact, in a recent paper based on analyses of TH2K prospective data, Roberts, Roberts and Chan report that risk of incident insomnia is predicted by many of the same somatic, psychological, and interpersonal factors included in the analyses reported here.

We find that insomnia has a direct effect on risk for major depression, increasing risk 2 – 3 fold in crude analyses and 2-fold in multivariate analyses, controlling for depression at baseline. Insomnia also increased risk of depressive symptoms, but the effect, while significant, was attenuated compared to major depression. When we examined the reverse, the results were similar. There was increased risk of insomnia among those with major depression as well as for depressive symptoms. These results, particularly for major depression, suggest that quantity of sleep, following DSM-IV guidelines increases risk for major depression, which in turn increases risk for decreased sleep. This is not surprising, given the phenomenology of both insomnia and major depression.\\n\\nOur results extend the available data on insomnia and depression and are the first prospective data on this question for adolescents. Clearly more data are needed on the prospective, reciprocal association between these major public health problems in adolescence. What is needed are studies which examine developmental trajectories of insomnia and depression from childhood through adolescence into adulthood.\\n\\nFollowing suggestions by Gruber and Brouillette, future studies should also focus on both objective and subjective measures of disturbed sleep, controlling for comorbid psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety disorders as well as other sleep disorders such as hypersomnia and nightmares.\\n\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': './Data/extracted/TÁC HẠI/nihms41505.md', 'title': 'Title: Chronic Insomnia and Its Negative Consequences for Health and Functioning of Adolescents: A 12-Month Prospective Study', 'summary': 'Summary: This study investigates the prevalence and chronicity of insomnia among adolescents, as well as its impact on their health and functioning.

Non-fatal suicidal behavior including suicidal thought (ST), suicide plan (SP), and suicide attempt (SA) has been identified as the strongest predictor of suicide death and is prevalent among adolescents. Non-fatal suicidal behavior is multifactorial. Numerous studies have shown demographical, biological, and psychosocial factors (i.e. female gender, age, parental separation, or divorce, serotonin activity, and mental disorders) are associated with non-fatal suicidal behavior.\\n\\nInsomnia disorder, manifested as recurrent and chronic perceived sleep dissatisfaction occurring several times per week, is one of the common sleep problems among adolescents. Insomnia symptoms are very common among adolescents. Growing studies have demonstrated that insomnia is a significant risk factor of adolescent suicidal behavior. The link between insomnia and suicidal behavior is complicated and may be mediated and/or moderated by multiple factors. Anxiety and depression have been considered the most common factors that mediate the association between insomnia and suicidal behavior. However, in a meta-analysis involving 39 studies, the authors found that insomnia, nightmares, and other sleep disturbances were significantly associated with suicidal behaviors, independent of depression and anxiety (adjusted risk ratio ranging from 1.66 to 3.00). That is, in the absence of depression and anxiety, the experience of insomnia also increases the risk of suicidal behavior. Recent studies have examined other mediators, such as defeat and entrapment, hopelessness, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and nightmares. However, all these factors were mostly examined in cross-sectional studies and these factors could only explain part of the association between insomnia and suicidal behavior. To develop effective prevention and intervention programs of suicidal behavior, it is important to identify modifiable factors that mediate the association between insomnia and suicidal behavior in adolescents.\\n\\nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is also prevalent in adolescents. EDS may be a potential mediator of the insomnia-suicidal behavior link because EDS is one of the most common consequences of insomnia and because EDS is associated with increased risk of suicidal behavior. For example, in a cross-sectional study of 36,743 adults, the risk of EDS was.

Table 5 presents the relationship between chronicity of individual items of insomnia and functioning problems controlling for prior functioning, age, gender, ethnicity, family income, puberty status, and perceived body weight. Out of 70 contrasts, only 27 were statistically significant. However, a third (32.6% of non-significant OR’s were in the range of 2 to 7, but the wide confidence intervals resulted in the associations not being significant. Chronic NRS predicted eight of the 14 outcomes with OR’s ranging from 2.0 – 3.3, followed by chronic DIS with six significant outcomes, with OR’s ranging from 2.5 to 6.7. Chronic DMS was least predictive of the symptoms examined. Chronic EMA was strongly related to perceived health (OR=19.4), life satisfaction (OR=15.1), and school work (OR=19.0).\\n\\nThis is the first study to examine the effects of chronic DSM-IV insomnia on subsequent functioning of adolescents using a prospective design. Rates of chronicity were substantial, with 46% reporting symptoms of insomnia in both Wave 1 and Wave 2, and nearly one-fourth meeting our definition of clinical insomnia. Our data on chronicity corroborate earlier studies of stability of symptoms of insomnia among adolescents.\\n\\nThe implications of the chronic burden of insomnia for adolescent well-being also are profound. With minor exceptions (e.g., peer relations), chronic insomnia increased the odds of poor outcomes across multiple indicators of interpersonal, somatic and psychological functioning. For most of these outcomes, the odds of poor functioning were increased from twofold to fivefold without adjustment for covariates. Even after adjustment, most of the prospective associations remained. These results extend the findings from prior prospective studies concerning the impact of sleep problems on future functioning of adolescents. two previous epidemiologic studies have provided data on changes in sleep over time and their impact on adolescents. Data from these studies are corroborated by our results. Fredriksen et al. reported sleep deprivation over time increased risk of depression and lower self-esteem but not poor academic functioning. Gregory and O’Connor reported that the correlation of sleep problems (including symptoms of insomnia) with depression and anxiety increased over time. Other measures of functioning were not examined in either paper. Roberts, Roberts, and Chen found that symptoms of insomnia at baseline increased future risk of poor functioning for multiple indicators of somatic, psychological and interpersonal functioning. However, they did not examine the effects of chronic insomnia nor insomnia approximating DSM-IV criteria.\\n\\nWhen individual symptoms of insomnia were examined, chronic nonrestorative sleep posed the greatest risk for Wave 2 outcomes, followed by chronic difficulty initiating sleep in terms of number of outcomes affected.\\n\\nTaken together, these previous prospective studies, together with the results presented here, confirm the findings on factors associated with insomnia reported from numerous cross-sectional studies of both adolescents and adults.\\n\\nThe key contribution of the results reported here is that many of the findings about factors associated with the occurrence of insomnia, which emanate overwhelmingly from cross-sectional studies, may be the consequences rather the causes of insomnia.

Non-fatal suicidal behavior including suicidal thought (ST), suicide plan (SP), and suicide attempt (SA) has been identified as the strongest predictor of suicide death and is prevalent among adolescents. Non-fatal suicidal behavior is multifactorial. Numerous studies have shown demographical, biological, and psychosocial factors (i.e. female gender, age, parental separation, or divorce, serotonin activity, and mental disorders) are associated with non-fatal suicidal behavior.\\n\\nInsomnia disorder, manifested as recurrent and chronic perceived sleep dissatisfaction occurring several times per week, is one of the common sleep problems among adolescents. Insomnia symptoms are very common among adolescents. Growing studies have demonstrated that insomnia is a significant risk factor of adolescent suicidal behavior. The link between insomnia and suicidal behavior is complicated and may be mediated and/or moderated by multiple factors. Anxiety and depression have been considered the most common factors that mediate the association between insomnia and suicidal behavior. However, in a meta-analysis involving 39 studies, the authors found that insomnia, nightmares, and other sleep disturbances were significantly associated with suicidal behaviors, independent of depression and anxiety (adjusted risk ratio ranging from 1.66 to 3.00).

Introduction\\n\\nCaffeine is a compound of many plants—a special psychostimulant, according to some data—and it is one of the most frequently used psychoactive substances in the world. After consumption, it is absorbed quickly.\\n\\nThe potential cellular effects of caffeine might be explained by three mechanisms:\\n- The antagonism of adenosine receptors (especially in the central nervous system/CNS);\\n- mobilization of the intracellular calcium storage (from the ER); and\\n- inhibition of phosphodiesterases.\\n\\nNowadays, the most well-recognized mechanism is that caffeine acts in the CNS as a competitor of adenosine in its receptors, inhibiting the negative effects that adenosine induces on neurotransmission, excitation, and pain perception.\\n\\nThrough blocking adenosine receptors (mainly A1 and A2A subtypes), caffeine seems to competitively antagonize their effect and cause an increased release of dopamine, noradrenalin, and glutamate. The adenosine receptor blocking ability of caffeine is visible at low doses as well, like in a single cup of coffee. Resulting in lower pain perception. '),\n",

While average daily caffeine intake among teens has been estimated at 50 mg, the amount consumed varies widely. For example, one study reported a range of 0–800 mg of caffeine intake per day over a 2-week period. Common caffeine sources among adolescents include soda, tea, coffee, and energy drinks, the last of which is particularly concerning given the high caffeine content. Although legal, widely used, and socially acceptable, when consumed in high amounts caffeine is nonetheless a psychoactive stimulant substance linked to detrimental effects on adolescent health and development, including cognitive, physiological, psychological, and cardiovascular functioning.\\n\\nHigh caffeine intake may be particularly harmful to adolescent sleep health. In particular, increased caffeine consumption may contribute to insufficient sleep among adolescents, including shorter duration, increased wake after sleep onset, and more difficulty falling or staying asleep, as assessed by parent or adolescent report, although not all studies have associated caffeine with adolescent sleep. Daytime sleepiness and dysfunction also have been linked to high caffeine intake among adolescents, suggesting a possible vicious cycle, in which caffeine interferes with sleep and results in daytime sleepiness, which, in turn, contributes to greater caffeine consumption. # Daily caffeine and EEG-measured sleep in adolescents\\n\\nDespite links between caffeine, sleep, and adolescent health, several critical questions remain.

Studies describing the effects of caffeine and caffeinated beverages show confusing results, so it seems important to regularly summarize the available facts, and in more detail. By a thorough analysis of more than 156 scientific papers, the authors describe the molecular background of absorption, as well as the positive and negative effects of different dosages of caffeine, just like its effects in physical activity and performance. ED and EDwA consumption is a regular habit of not only adults, but nowadays even of children and adolescents. There are no safe dosages described of caffeine or ED consumption for children. There are no positive short- or long-term effects of these compounds/products concerning developing brain functions, psycho-motor functions, or social development. Instead, there are many unpleasant side effects, and symptoms of regular or higher-dose ED consumption, especially at younger ages. This mini review describes many details of these unpleasant side effects, their severity, and motivations for consuming these compounds/products. In a quantitative research in Hungary (10–26 years, mean age: 15.6 ± 3.8 y, 1459 subjects, randomly chosen population), a survey based on a questionnaire asking people about their ED consumption habits was conducted. According to the data, 81.8% of the participants consumed EDs at least once, and 63.3% tried several products of the kind. A positive correlation was found between age and consumption (p < 0.001). The results show that a high proportion of this group often consumed EDwA, in many cases leading to harmful side-effects of caffeine overdose.
