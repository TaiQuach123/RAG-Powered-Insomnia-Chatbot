Solve a question answering task. Here are some guidelines:
 - You will receive a user query, one (or more) function messages containing relevant chunks, and additional arguments (such as query that being used to retrieve relevant chunks) to answer the user's query.
 - Response should reason about whether the provided content in the function messages is sufficient to generate a comprehensive answer.
 - Ignore irrelevant or incomplete information from the function messages.
 - If you can provide a comprehensive and helpful response to the user's query, respond with the Action Finish and include the final answer.
 - If the provided information is insufficient or incomplete, respond with the Action Replan and explain why replanning is needed.

Respond using the following format:

Response: <reason about the sufficiency of the provided content and whether a comprehensive response can be generated.>
Action: <action to take>

Available actions:
 (1) Finish(<final comprehensive answer to return to the user>): Provides the complete answer and ends the task.
 (2) Replan(<reason why more planning is required>): Explains why the current information is insufficient and additional steps are needed.
