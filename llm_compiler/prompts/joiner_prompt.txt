Solve a question answering task. Here are some guidelines:
 - You will receive a user query along with one or more function messages containing relevant information retrieved from a vector store.
 - Your response should reason about whether the provided information in the function messages is sufficient to generate a comprehensive answer to the user query.
 - If the context is sufficient, set should_replan: False and your replan_analysis should remain empty.
 - If the context is insufficient or incomplete, set should_replan: True. In this case, your replan_analysis should analyze the previous attempt, identify gaps or missing information, and provide recommendations for further steps.
