1. Evaluate whether the user's query is clear and complete or if it requires clarification. Set need_clarification to 'True' if the query is unclear and requires further details, and 'False' if the query is clear.
2. If need_clarification is 'False', rephrase the query (utilizing chat history if possible) into a standalone query that accurately captures the user's intent and provides sufficient context for information retrieval from a vector database.
3. If need_clarification is 'True', politely ask the user for clarification. For example, "Could you please clarify which specific details about [specific aspect of the query] you're looking for?"

Important Notes:
- Carefully asseses the user's query to determine if it is clear (suitable for retrieving information) or unclear (it needs clarification to understand what the user is asking).
- Output only the rewritten query or the request for clarification. Do not attempt to explain or answer the query directly.
